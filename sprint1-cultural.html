    <h1>The Brife Introduction of Chinese Kung Fu</h1>
    
    <h3></h3>
    
    <p>
      Chinese kung fu, also known as wushu or Chinese martial arts, is an important part of traditional Chinese culture. It is probably one of the earliest and longest lasting sports, which utilizes both brawn and brain. Different from self-defense and boxing, kung fu is more holistic, developing internal discipline with external technique

    <h2>Chinese Kung Fu History</h2>
    <p>
      The theory of kung fu is based upon classical Chinese philosophy. Over its long history it has developed as a unique combination of exercise, practical self-defense, self-discipline, and art.

       It is estimated that Chinese Kung Fu can be dated back to primeval society. At that time people used cudgels to fight against wild beasts. Gradually they accumulated experience in self defense. When the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BC) began, hunting was considered as an important measure of kung fu training...

    <h2> he Theory of Kung Fu </h2>
    <p>
       Chinese kung fu is a large system of theory and practice. It combines techniques of self-defense and health-keeping.

     <p>
       In sports like track and field, ball sports, weightlifting, and boxing, an athlete typically has to retire from full participation in his 30s. Injuries sustained during years of active sport participation at a young age can affect our ability to continue exercising in later life.
      </p> 
     <p>
       In Chinese kung fu however, a distinction is made between "external" and "internal" kung fu. It is said that "In external kung fu, you exercise your tendons, bones, and skin; in internal kung fu, you train your spirit, your qi, and your mind." And so internal kung fu can continue later in life, when the external body weakens.
