Describe the process for solving problems	1) Get intentional and habitual, being intentional about developing habits that will grow you as a learner and as a programmer; 2) strat your timer; 3) Understand: Get clear on what is being asked, know exactly what is being asked, most hard problems are hard because you don't understand them, write down the problem in plain English, doodle a diagram, or tell someone or something about it; 4) Plan: Plan your approach, don't start hacking straight away, give your brain time to analyse the problem and process the information;5) Divide: Break into samll steps; the most important step of all! break a big problem into sub-problems, these sub-problems are much easier to solverm, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer(or are closer to that answer). Then connect the dots, connecting all you sub-solutions will give you the solutions to the orinal problem. 6) Make an attempt at solving it(write initial solution piecd it together and start solveing the code); 7) get unstuck; Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Reassess: Take s step back, look at the problem from another perspective, is there anying that can be abstracted to a more general approach? Reserch: Google it, no maater what problem you have, someone has probably solve it.  8) Imrpove your solution(Refactor) refactoring is not about solving the problem differently, it's about solving the problem well, good solutions don't just work, they are clear.; 9) Learn what you learned(Reflect)ask yourself the two questions at the end of day (1) Have I reach my goals for today? (2)what have I learned today?; 10)  Practice, don't expect to be great after just one sprint, if you want to be a good problem-solver, solver a lot of problems! Practice, practice, practice, it'll only be a matter of time before you recognise that: this problem could easily be solved with ...""
